Those inclined to hack the server sources
may wish to read some or all of the following:

    (1) version_src.txt

    How source information gets included into the executable, and
    What you need to do if you are a package maintainer or 
    are running a public server with sources modified beyond 
    the usual (un)setting of options.h macros.

    (2) AddingNewMOOTypes.txt

    A list of all of the places that need to be modified if you are adding
    a new value type to the MOO language/server.

    (3) MOOCodeSequences.txt

    How all of the statement/expression constructs in the language 
    translate to byte code.
